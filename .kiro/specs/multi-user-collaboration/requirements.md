# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Recording & Variable Management feature will significantly improve the browser automation experience by providing intelligent variable extraction, intuitive variable customization interfaces, and seamless automation sharing capabilities. This feature addresses the core need for users to easily record complex workflows, automatically identify reusable parameters, and share automations in a user-friendly format.

This enhancement will enable users to record browser interactions with automatic variable detection, customize variables through an intuitive table interface before execution, and share automations as structured variable mappings combined with natural language prompts that can be easily understood and reused by others.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to record my browser interactions with enhanced capture capabilities so that the system can automatically detect and extract reusable variables from my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start recording THEN the system SHALL capture all browser interactions including clicks, typing, navigation, and form submissions with precise element identification
2. WHEN I perform typing actions THEN the system SHALL automatically detect potential variables such as names, emails, dates, numbers, and other data patterns
3. WHEN I interact with form fields THEN the system SHALL capture field labels, types, and values to enable intelligent variable mapping
4. IF I navigate between pages THEN the system SHALL record the complete navigation flow and identify dynamic URL parameters
5. WHEN recording is stopped THEN the system SHALL immediately analyze captured actions and present detected variables for review

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see an interactive table/form interface when replaying automations so that I can customize variables before execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select an automation to run THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive variable configuration table with all extracted variables
2. WHEN viewing the variable table THEN the system SHALL show variable name, type, current value, description, and example values for each detected variable
3. WHEN I modify variable values THEN the system SHALL validate inputs based on variable type and provide real-time feedback
4. IF variables have dependencies or constraints THEN the system SHALL enforce validation rules and show helpful error messages
5. WHEN I confirm variable settings THEN the system SHALL execute the automation using the customized values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want intelligent variable detection and categorization so that the system can automatically identify different types of data in my recorded actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is typed during recording THEN the system SHALL automatically categorize it as email, name, phone, date, URL, or generic text based on patterns
2. WHEN form selections are made THEN the system SHALL detect dropdown options, checkbox states, and radio button selections as selectable variables
3. WHEN numerical values are entered THEN the system SHALL identify them as numbers, currencies, percentages, or quantities with appropriate formatting
4. IF sensitive data patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them as potentially sensitive and require explicit user confirmation
5. WHEN similar patterns appear multiple times THEN the system SHALL suggest consolidating them into reusable variable definitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to share my automations with others by providing the variable mappings and natural language prompts so that they can easily understand and use my workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I choose to share an automation THEN the system SHALL generate a shareable package containing variable definitions and natural language descriptions
2. WHEN creating the share package THEN the system SHALL convert recorded actions into human-readable prompts like "Enter your email in the login field"
3. WHEN variables are included in sharing THEN the system SHALL provide clear descriptions, examples, and validation rules for each variable
4. IF the automation contains sensitive variables THEN the system SHALL allow selective sharing and provide placeholder values
5. WHEN someone receives a shared automation THEN the system SHALL present it with clear instructions and pre-filled variable examples

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize variable properties and validation rules so that I can ensure data quality and provide better guidance for automation reuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I edit a variable THEN the system SHALL allow me to modify its name, description, type, default value, and validation rules
2. WHEN setting validation rules THEN the system SHALL support regex patterns, min/max values, required fields, and custom validation messages
3. WHEN I define variable examples THEN the system SHALL store multiple example values to help other users understand expected formats
4. IF I mark variables as sensitive THEN the system SHALL mask their values in the interface and exclude them from sharing by default
5. WHEN variables are saved THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration and warn about potential conflicts or issues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to import and use shared automations with their variable configurations so that I can benefit from others' work while customizing it for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import a shared automation THEN the system SHALL load all variable definitions with their descriptions and validation rules
2. WHEN reviewing imported variables THEN the system SHALL show the original creator's examples and guidance alongside my customization options
3. WHEN I modify imported variables THEN the system SHALL preserve the original definitions while allowing local customizations
4. IF imported automations have missing dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify them and guide me through resolution
5. WHEN I execute imported automations THEN the system SHALL use my customized variable values while maintaining the original workflow logic

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see variable usage analytics and suggestions so that I can optimize my automations and discover reusable patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view automation details THEN the system SHALL show which variables are most commonly modified and which use default values
2. WHEN analyzing variable patterns THEN the system SHALL suggest opportunities to create reusable variable sets or templates
3. WHEN variables fail validation frequently THEN the system SHALL recommend improvements to validation rules or default values
4. IF similar variables exist across automations THEN the system SHALL suggest consolidation or standardization opportunities
5. WHEN sharing automations THEN the system SHALL provide usage statistics to help others understand variable importance and frequency

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced variable extraction from complex web interactions so that the system can handle dynamic content and advanced form controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I interact with dynamic content THEN the system SHALL detect AJAX-loaded elements and capture their variable nature
2. WHEN I use complex form controls THEN the system SHALL extract variables from multi-select dropdowns, date pickers, file uploads, and rich text editors
3. WHEN I perform conditional actions THEN the system SHALL identify branching logic and create conditional variable sets
4. IF I interact with tables or lists THEN the system SHALL detect repeating patterns and suggest loop variables or bulk operations
5. WHEN I work with multi-step forms THEN the system SHALL maintain variable context across form pages and identify dependencies between steps
