# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current automation system has a basic play button functionality that can execute saved automations, but it lacks comprehensive replay capabilities, proper variable handling, real-time feedback, and robust error handling. Users need an enhanced replay system that provides reliable execution of their recorded automations with clear progress tracking, variable management, and debugging capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an automation user, I want to replay my saved automations with a single click from the left panel, so that I can quickly execute my recorded workflows without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the play button on an automation THEN the system SHALL start executing all recorded steps in sequence
2. WHEN an automation has no variables THEN the system SHALL execute immediately without prompting
3. WHEN an automation has variables THEN the system SHALL prompt me to provide values before execution
4. WHEN I provide variable values THEN the system SHALL substitute them in the appropriate steps during execution
5. WHEN an automation is running THEN the play button SHALL show a pause/stop icon and be disabled

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an automation user, I want to see real-time progress and feedback while my automation is running, so that I can monitor execution and understand what's happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an automation starts THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator showing current step and total steps
2. WHEN each step executes THEN the system SHALL show which action is being performed
3. WHEN a step completes successfully THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation
4. WHEN a step takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
5. WHEN the automation completes THEN the system SHALL display a success summary with execution time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an automation user, I want proper error handling and recovery options during automation replay, so that I can troubleshoot issues and resume execution when possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a step fails during execution THEN the system SHALL pause and display the specific error
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL offer options to retry the failed step or skip it
3. WHEN network issues cause timeouts THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN elements are not found THEN the system SHALL wait and retry before failing
5. WHEN an automation fails THEN the system SHALL save the execution log for debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an automation user, I want to manage variable values efficiently during replay, so that I can reuse automations with different data sets easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an automation has variables THEN the system SHALL show a clear variable input form
2. WHEN I've used an automation before THEN the system SHALL remember my previous variable values
3. WHEN variables have validation rules THEN the system SHALL validate inputs before starting execution
4. WHEN I want to save variable sets THEN the system SHALL allow me to create named variable profiles
5. WHEN executing with variables THEN the system SHALL show which variables are being used in each step

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an automation user, I want to control automation execution with pause, resume, and stop functionality, so that I can intervene when necessary and manage long-running automations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an automation is running THEN the system SHALL provide pause and stop buttons
2. WHEN I pause an automation THEN the system SHALL complete the current step and wait for resume
3. WHEN I resume a paused automation THEN the system SHALL continue from the next step
4. WHEN I stop an automation THEN the system SHALL immediately halt execution and reset the state
5. WHEN I close the browser during execution THEN the system SHALL handle the interruption gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an automation user, I want to see detailed execution logs and results after replay, so that I can verify the automation worked correctly and troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an automation completes THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed execution report
2. WHEN steps extract data THEN the system SHALL show the extracted values in the results
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL include screenshots and error details in the log
4. WHEN I want to review past executions THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of automation runs
5. WHEN sharing results THEN the system SHALL allow exporting execution logs and screenshots
