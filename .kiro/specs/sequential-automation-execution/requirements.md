# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current browser automation system executes individual steps in isolation rather than flowing through multiple steps in sequence. Users expect the system to handle complex automation workflows that involve navigation, form filling, data extraction, and multi-page interactions seamlessly. The system should be able to execute complete automation sequences rather than requiring manual intervention between each step.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an automation user, I want to create and execute multi-step automation workflows that can navigate through multiple pages and perform complex interactions without manual intervention, so that I can automate complete business processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an automation with multiple steps THEN the system SHALL execute all steps in sequence without stopping
2. WHEN an automation includes navigation steps THEN the system SHALL wait for page loads and continue to the next step automatically
3. WHEN an automation encounters form fields THEN the system SHALL fill all required fields and submit forms as part of the sequence
4. WHEN an automation needs to extract data from multiple pages THEN the system SHALL navigate between pages and collect data continuously
5. WHEN an automation step fails THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms and error recovery options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an automation user, I want the system to handle dynamic content and timing issues automatically, so that my automations work reliably across different network conditions and page load times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page is loading THEN the system SHALL wait for the page to be fully loaded before proceeding
2. WHEN dynamic content is being loaded THEN the system SHALL wait for elements to become available
3. WHEN network conditions are slow THEN the system SHALL adjust timeouts automatically
4. WHEN elements are not immediately visible THEN the system SHALL scroll and wait for visibility
5. WHEN JavaScript is modifying the page THEN the system SHALL wait for DOM stability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an automation user, I want to create conditional logic and branching in my automation workflows, so that I can handle different scenarios and business rules automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an automation encounters different page states THEN the system SHALL execute appropriate conditional branches
2. WHEN data validation is required THEN the system SHALL check conditions and proceed accordingly
3. WHEN multiple paths are possible THEN the system SHALL choose the correct path based on page content
4. WHEN error conditions occur THEN the system SHALL execute fallback procedures
5. WHEN business rules need to be applied THEN the system SHALL evaluate conditions and take appropriate actions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an automation user, I want to monitor and control long-running automation sequences, so that I can track progress and intervene when necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an automation is running THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates
2. WHEN an automation is executing THEN the system SHALL allow pause and resume functionality
3. WHEN an automation encounters issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information
4. WHEN an automation is paused THEN the system SHALL maintain state and allow manual intervention
5. WHEN an automation completes THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive execution reports

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an automation user, I want to create reusable automation components and templates, so that I can build complex workflows efficiently and maintain consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating automations THEN the system SHALL allow creation of reusable step templates
2. WHEN building workflows THEN the system SHALL provide pre-built components for common actions
3. WHEN sharing automations THEN the system SHALL package complete workflows with dependencies
4. WHEN importing automations THEN the system SHALL resolve dependencies and configure components
5. WHEN updating templates THEN the system SHALL propagate changes to dependent automations
