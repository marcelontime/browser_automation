# Automation System Debugging Requirements

## Introduction

This spec addresses the critical debugging and fixing of the browser automation system to enable proper testing with Playwright MCP. The system currently has several blocking issues preventing successful automation execution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Key Configuration Fix

**User Story:** As a developer testing the automation system, I want the OpenAI API key to be properly configured so that Stagehand can execute AI-powered browser actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the API key SHALL be properly loaded from environment variables
2. WHEN a new session is created THEN the API key SHALL be passed correctly to the Stagehand engine
3. WHEN processing instructions THEN the system SHALL have access to the OpenAI API for AI-powered actions
4. IF the API key is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 2: Stagehand Engine Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer using the automation system, I want Stagehand actions to execute without undefined property errors so that browser automation commands work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing browser actions THEN the system SHALL handle all Stagehand responses without undefined property errors
2. WHEN processing element interactions THEN the system SHALL properly parse and handle element selectors
3. WHEN encountering errors THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages instead of generic Stagehand errors
4. IF an action fails THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery or provide alternative approaches

### Requirement 3: WebSocket Handler Function Fix

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the web interface, I want all UI controls to work properly so that I can control the automation system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking manual mode toggle THEN the system SHALL execute the toggle function without errors
2. WHEN using any UI control THEN all handler functions SHALL be properly defined and accessible
3. WHEN WebSocket messages are received THEN the system SHALL route them to the correct handler functions
4. IF a handler function is missing THEN the system SHALL provide graceful error handling

### Requirement 4: Missing Module Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer running the automation system, I want all required modules to be available so that the system runs with full functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN all required modules SHALL be available or have proper fallbacks
2. WHEN robust element interaction is needed THEN the system SHALL either use the module or provide alternative interaction methods
3. WHEN modules are missing THEN the system SHALL log warnings but continue operating
4. IF critical modules are missing THEN the system SHALL provide installation instructions or auto-install them

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the automation system, I want comprehensive error logging and recovery mechanisms so that I can identify and fix issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces
2. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery where possible
3. WHEN errors are logged THEN they SHALL include context about the current operation and session
4. IF recovery is not possible THEN the system SHALL provide clear next steps for manual resolution

### Requirement 6: Playwright MCP Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want to execute comprehensive test scenarios using Playwright MCP so that I can validate the automation system works correctly across different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting via Playwright MCP THEN the system SHALL accept and process automation commands
2. WHEN executing multi-step workflows THEN the system SHALL maintain state between steps
3. WHEN testing different websites THEN the system SHALL handle various page structures and elements
4. WHEN running test scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback and results
5. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure information for debugging

### Requirement 7: Performance and Reliability Improvements

**User Story:** As a user of the automation system, I want reliable and fast automation execution so that my workflows complete successfully without timeouts or failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing automations THEN the system SHALL complete actions within reasonable timeouts
2. WHEN handling multiple sessions THEN the system SHALL manage resources efficiently
3. WHEN processing complex pages THEN the system SHALL handle iframes and dynamic content properly
4. IF performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring and optimization suggestions
