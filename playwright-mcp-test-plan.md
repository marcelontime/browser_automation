- ✅ Variable substitution works across all steps
- ✅ Error recovery mechanisms activate when needed
- ✅ Real-time progress updates via WebSocket
- ✅ Workflows can be paused/resumed/stopped
- ✅ Data extraction and validation work correctly
- ✅ Complex conditional logic executes properly

### Performance Targets

- **Success Rate**: 90%+ with error recovery
- **Response Time**: Real-time updates within 100ms
- **Memory Usage**: Stable throughout long workflows

## Test Data Requirements

### Variables for Testing
```javascript
const testVariables = {
  // User data
  testUser: {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe", 
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
    phone: "+1-555-0123",
    address: "123 Test Street",
    city: "Test City",
    zipCode: "12345"
  },
  
  // E-commerce data
  products: ["laptop", "mouse", "keyboard"],
  budget: 1000,
  quantity: 2,
  
  // Banking data
  accountNumber: "123456789",
  routingNumber: "987654321",
  transferAmount: 100.00,
  
  // Search criteria
  jobTitle: "Software Engineer",
  location: "Remote",
  salaryMin: 80000
};
```

## Monitoring and Validation

### Real-time Monitoring
- WebSocket connection status
- Step execution progress
- Variable state changes
- Error occurrences and recovery
- Performance metrics

### Validation Points
- Page navigation success
- Form submission completion
- Data extraction accuracy
- Variable substitution correctness
- Error handling effectiveness
- Final workflow outcomes

## Test Execution Commands

### Start Server
```bash
cd /path/to/browser-automation
npm start
# Server should be running on http://localhost:7079
```

### Playwright MCP Test Execution
We'll use the Playwright MCP to execute these tests by connecting to the WebSocket endpoint and sending workflow execution commands.

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **Network timeouts** - Use adaptive timeout strategies
2. **Element not found** - Implement robust element waiting
3. **Page load delays** - Use smart page load detection
4. **Dynamic content** - Wait for DOM stability
5. **Rate limiting** - Add appropriate delays between requests

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive error handling in each test
- Fallback scenarios for critical paths
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Cleanup procedures for failed tests
- Resource management and cleanup

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Test Pass Rate**: Target 95%+
- **Average Execution Time**: Baseline vs. workflow comparison
- **Error Recovery Rate**: Percentage of recovered failures
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU during execution

### Qualitative Metrics
- **User Experience**: Smooth, uninterrupted execution
- **Reliability**: Consistent results across multiple runs
- **Maintainability**: Easy to modify and extend workflows
- **Debugging**: Clear error messages and execution logs

This comprehensive test plan will thoroughly validate that the sequential automation execution system works as designed, handling complex real-world scenarios without manual intervention.
