# üîß CRITICAL SCREENSHOT FIXES APPLIED

## Issue: Blank Screens - Screenshots Not Displaying

### Root Causes Found:

1. **‚ùå Wrong Method Call**: `handleScreenshotRequest` was calling `this.automationEngine.takeScreenshot()` but `this.automationEngine` doesn't exist at server level
2. **‚ùå Field Name Mismatch**: Real-time screenshots sent `data` field but frontend expected `screenshot` field

### Fixes Applied:

#### 1. Fixed Screenshot Request Handler
```javascript
// Before (BROKEN): Using non-existent this.automationEngine
async handleScreenshotRequest(ws) {
    const screenshot = await this.automationEngine.takeScreenshot(); // ‚ùå DOESN'T EXIST
}

// After (FIXED): Using session-specific automation engine
async handleScreenshotRequest(userSession) {
    if (!userSession.automationEngine || !userSession.automationEngine.page) {
        throw new Error('Automation engine not available');
    }
    
    const screenshot = await userSession.automationEngine.page.screenshot({
        type: 'jpeg',
        quality: 80
    });
}
```

#### 2. Fixed Frontend Field Mismatch
```javascript
// Before (BROKEN): Looking for wrong field name
case 'real_time_screenshot':
    if (data.screenshot) { // ‚ùå Field doesn't exist
        const imageUrl = `data:image/jpeg;base64,${data.screenshot}`;
        setScreenshotSrc(imageUrl);
    }

// After (FIXED): Using correct field name
case 'real_time_screenshot':
    if (data.data) { // ‚úÖ Correct field name
        const imageUrl = `data:image/jpeg;base64,${data.data}`;
        setScreenshotSrc(imageUrl);
    }
```

### Status: 
These fixes should resolve the blank screen issue where:
- Screenshots were being requested but failing silently
- Real-time screenshots were being sent but not displayed in UI
- Both regular and real-time screenshot systems were broken

### Next Steps:
1. Restart server with fixes
2. Test screenshot capture functionality
3. Verify both regular and real-time screenshots work
4. Confirm recording system captures screenshots properly
